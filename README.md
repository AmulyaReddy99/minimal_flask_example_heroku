Here's a quick guide to each of the files and information whether you need to edit each:

# Files you'll need to edit

* README: This is the file you're currently reading. You'll probably want to update this to have information about your specific API and how to use it.
* openapi.yaml: This is the specficiation file that we wrote on day 1. ([The notebook's here if you need a refresher](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/careercon-intro-to-apis)). You'll want to replace this file with the OpenAPI file you wrote on day 1. 
* 

# File you don't need to edit

* LICENSE: This file is the liscense your code is released under. If you don't inclde a liscense, other folks won't be able to reuse your code. If you fork this repository for your own work, you'll need to keep the liscense. I've used Apache 2.0 here becuase that's the same liscense as public Kaggle Kernels. 
* Procfile: This file is required by Heroku. It tells Heroku how to run your application. You probably don't need to change this file. 
*
